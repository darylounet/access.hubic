<p>The HubiC plugin is still experimental, and shall be used to access a hubiC account via their API. To use it, you must first register and <a href="https://hubic.com/home/browser/developers/" target="_blank">get your API Key</a>. This is typically a driver with wich you create a Repository Template, leaving the users credential empty and filling only your API Key info : that way, the users are able to access their own HubiC account without the administrator having to know their credentials, but using a shared API Key. See the documentation about the Repository Templates.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stackforge/openstack-sdk-php" target="_blank">openstack-sdk-php</a> package must also be installed on your server in order to make the connection.</p>
